# Eerie Daoist Enigma Website

Welcome to the **Eerie Daoist Enigma** website, a unique online experience inspired by a chilling horror novel. Drawing its essence from the unsettling ambiance of this novel.(道诡异仙)

All the illustrations were generated using MidJourney, as part of my exploration in the field of prompts. They were created in SS2023. GSAP was used as the animation library for the base scroll implementation.




## Project Theme and Inspiration

The project theme, **Eerie Daoist Enigma**, is derived from a spine-chilling horror novel that instills a sense of mystery and intrigue. The website's design and content are deeply influenced by the eerie atmosphere present in the novel. Traditional folklore and elements of Taoism further enhance the mystical and haunting narrative



## Artistic Illustrations

All the illustrations featured on the website are crafted by **midijourney**. The artwork seamlessly integrates Taoist elements, mystical symbolism, and the eerie aesthetics of the horror genre.
